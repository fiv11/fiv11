- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @fiv11 or Foivos and I'm 19y.o. Nice to meet you! c:

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m starting to get very interesting to coding. Even tho I'm still a newbie. My dream goal is to be able to design games. I've been a gamer since I was 6y.o.!
 Also I love music, and I write my own songs when I feel like I want to. Mostly: rap, trap, rock, pop alternatives, generally, different sounds and/or mindblowing lyrics.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything. Taking baby-steps rn, still in progress.

- ðŸ“« If you're seeing this, and the status is outdated (because its probably something I'll forget), still on this platform, evolved and somewhat experienced,
 the email I use most is foivosloustis866@gmail.com, you can also add me on discord fiv#1411
